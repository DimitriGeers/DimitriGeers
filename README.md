## Hi, I'm Dimitri!
**Service Delivery Manager | Analyst | Product Owner**

I thrive at the intersection of technology and business, where strategy meets execution. With a passion for delivering value and a love for solving complex problems, my role revolves around ensuring that teams work harmoniously to exceed customer expectations.


### What I Do:

- **Service Delivery Management:** I oversee the end-to-end delivery process, ensuring services are delivered on time, within scope, and aligned with business goals. I bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders, making sure everyone is on the same page.

- **Functional & Business Analysis:** I look into business requirements, translate them into actionable tasks, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to implement solutions that drive growth and efficiency.

- **Product Ownership:** I prioritise features, manage backlogs, and work closely with development teams to deliver products that resonate with users and stakeholders alike.


### Continuous Improvement:

I believe in the power of continuous learning and always seek out opportunities to expand my skill set. Whether it's exploring the world of code, or fine-tuning my leadership skills, I'm committed to staying at the forefront of my field.



### Let's Connect!
